**Snowdrops**

A car pulled from the bottom of the Yenisei River after 20 years

Cars used to be made sturdy: a Mitsubishi Galant is being pulled from the bottom of the Yenisei, having sunk there 20 years ago and involved in a criminal case in the 90s. The bodies inside have decayed somewhat, but the car itself is in decent condition. Everything is like in a story by Mayne Reid: "The horse was not very large, but beautifully built. The same could not be said for the rider—he was missing his head. However, the head was there, just not in its place. It was located at the front of the saddle." The same goes for the man in the Galant. His head was found nearby, in the cabin. A woman was also found in the same cabin—part of the package. The doors wouldn’t open, so rescuers had to cut off the roof to retrieve the bodies. But weld it back on, clean the Galant of silt—and it can go to the auto flea market. The rescuers discovered the car during a planned exercise—in the winter, right in the center of Krasnoyarsk, behind the Rest Island and the Central Stadium, 20 meters from the shore at a depth of three meters.

Later, officials announced: they identified the man (his wife reported him missing in 1995), while they are still working to identify his eternally young companion; "the duration of the bodies' stay underwater is indicated by the items in the car: a hairdryer and cosmetics produced in the 90s"; they were dressed in what people wore in the 90s; these two died a non-violent death.

This is not a time loop or an overly long echo of the 90s; it’s the order of things—winter is long here, and patience is needed to wait for the "snowdrops": the corpses from the 90s have only just begun to thaw. Why this is the case is a separate conversation; for now, I’ll say this: in modern Russia, the renewal in the professional environment, including in law enforcement, happens faster than the renewal of political elites. But spring is inevitable, and it reveals who has made a mess. In the police and investigative circles, this is called "newly discovered circumstances." A new generation has taken over, and that has been enough for the ice to start melting, exposing what lies beneath.

In the near future, Krasnoyarsk will be presented with bodies related to high-profile disappearances from that era. 

Can you imagine what will happen with the renewal of elites in politics?

Sources from "Novaya" in the investigative team dealing with the case of the recently arrested Anatoly Bykov indicate that the search for the bodies of the missing Andrei Inin and Dmitry Gerasimov from 1994 is nearing a logical conclusion—the area has been identified, and searchers are now working with a ground-penetrating radar. Additionally, soon there will be complete information, if not about the disappearance in 1998 of businessman and government official Andrei Cherkashin, then about the person directly involved in his kidnapping and murder—his body is also being brought to the surface. And that’s not all.

They are not just pulling a dull Galant from the bottom of the Yenisei; they are pulling an entire two-story bus, packed to the brim.

Krasnoyarsk has lived with a psychological trauma for a quarter of a century, in an upside-down world: everyone who consciously experienced the 90s knows (no court decisions are required for this) who this "bus" belongs to, who the sticky fear that spread through the streets belongs to, the fear for growing daughters and sons, the fear in the eyes of businessmen. Everyone here knows who did what back then. These people became deputies of the city council, the regional legislative assembly, the State Duma; they entered power back in the 90s and 2000s, giving orders to prosecutors and law enforcement officials, teaching the people about life from their television screens, reading morals. A whole life has passed with them.

In the mid-90s, after Andrei Inin had already disappeared, his father, Nikolai Semyonovich, came to me. He brought three invoices for the transportation of cargo (three Grand Cherokee SUVs) in railway containers from Moscow to Krasnoyarsk. The recipient was listed as Alexander Chuchalov, also a young guy from Bykov's circle, like Inin. The cargo was received on January 12, 1994. According to Nikolai Semyonovich, one SUV was gifted by Bykov to his son (and eight months later, on the night of his son's disappearance, someone drove the car into their yard), another was given to his son

In the list of developers of the 18th microdistrict of Ovinnoe, besides these four, there is another from Kolchak (Igor Kolchin) and Kisa (Styazhkov), but they immediately withdrew from the project; they did not live here. The construction was carried out by the scientific and technical association "Santr"; all the first owners of the houses, including Bykov, were listed as its employees. And all, except for Bykov, were killed. Inin's cottage was later transferred to Chelyantano (Ismailov), who disappeared (was killed) in 1996, and then the house passed to Alexeyev, who remains unharmed to this day.

The red-brick cottages, all identical, were reportedly built according to Kolchak's sketch — he had a mansion in Karaulnaya Gora, in Pokrovka, near the chapel of Paraskeva Friday (which is also depicted on the paper chervonets), hovering over Krasnoyarsk in the same "expensive-rich" style. Apparently, he was inspired by the neighboring gypsy barons who became rich from heroin buried in the gardens behind their palaces. But I think Kolchak's tastes had nothing to do with it. Back home, near Nazarovo, Bykov has a fortress of the same architecture.

At that time, in the fall of 1993, the general director of KrAZ, Turushev, was brutally beaten with rebar (on October 20, he leaves in the morning with his young wife to the car to go to the factory, and guys in balaclavas attack him) and Lyapa was killed (on November 23).

Now Bykov is trying to convince the investigation in every way that Naumov was small-time and uninteresting. Apparently, that’s why he settled him nearby and gave him a jeep from the first batch of "Americans" in the city.

Lyapa, a 37-year-old master of sports in wrestling, will be riddled with bullets at 11 a.m. near the Gramophone House. Lipnyagov will arrive at the meeting driving, with his wife in the back seat, a pump-action shotgun resting on the knees of bodyguard Novikov, covered. After opening fire in response and surviving, he will later recount the details.

The gunmen fire from pistols, shooting through the storefront, wounding passersby with blind bullets. To put an end to it, they throw a hand grenade. It results in ellipsis: it does not explode. However, it no longer matters to Lyapa. Novikov knocks one of the attackers down, injures another. They flee, and Novikov chases after them. The killers stop a random car on the avenue, press a gun to the driver's temple. And they disappear. It’s like a movie.

Before this shootout, the killers had been guests in the house of an authority figure. His wife fed them dumplings. They ate at his home and knew that soon they would kill both him and possibly her. They joked about something, exchanged glances.

Lyapa had contracted these killers to kill Bykov. The city’s criminal police knew and tried to prevent the conflict, negotiating with both Lyapa and Bykov. As the head of the department, Vladimir Komlev, told me in his office, despite all the persuasion, Lyapa swore: "First, I will take care of Bykov, and then — please — I will hand over all the weapons to you." Bykov also does not hide his decisive dislike for Lyapa and his henchmen. "Lyapa wants war; he will get it."

They are called in together and seated at a table facing each other. No, the antagonism is extreme.

Neither in the criminal circles nor in the police — I spoke with everyone — was there any divergence of opinions about the mechanics of what happened. Initially, Lyapa ordered
